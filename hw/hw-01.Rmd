# Learning goals 

This assignment is a review of multiple linear regression. The goal is that by the end of the assignment, you are able to 

- produce and interpret plots and summary statistics.
- fit and interpret the coefficients of a linear model.
- use statistical inference to draw conclusions about predictor variables.
- understand assumptions for linear regression and identify potential violations.
- use statistical measures to select model of best fit. 
- complete assignment using a reproducible workflow that includes writing results in R Markdown and using GitHub for version control.

# Exercises 

*Note: All exercises are adapted from exercises in Chapter 1 of Beyond Multiple Linear Regression.*

## Conceptual exercises 

1. Researchers record the number of cricket chirps per minute and temperature during that time to investigate whether the number of chirps varies with the temperature.^[from Sec. 1.8.1, Ex 1]
  
    **a.** Identify the response and explanatory variable(s).
    
    **b.** Write the assumptions for linear regression in the context of the problem. 

2. For each of over 27,000 overnight permits for the Boundary Waters Canoe area, the zip code for the group leader has been translated to the distance traveled and socioeconomic data. Thus, for each zip code we can model the number of trips made as a function of distance traveled and various socioeconomic measures. ^[from Sec. 1.8.1, Ex 2]

    **a.** Identify the response and explanatory variable(s). 
    
    **b.** Identify which model assumption(s) are violated. Briefly explain your choice.

3. In a 2011 article in *The Sport Journal*, @farrar2011new attempt to show that Major League Baseball general managers did not immediately embrace the findings of Michael Lewis’s book *Moneyball* [@lewis2004moneyball]. They contend that players’ on-base percentage remained relatively undercompensated compared to slugging percentage three years after the book came out. Two regression models are described: Team Run Production Model and Player Salary Model.^[from Sec. 1.8.1, Ex 4]

    [Click here](articles/thesportjournal.org-A New Test of the Moneyball Hypothesis.pdf) for a PDF of the article.
    
    **a.** In Table 3: Coefficients for the Team Run Production Model (pg.9-10), the authors contend that Model 1 is better than Model 3.
    Could you argue that Model 3 is actually better? Briefly epxlain. 
    
    **b.** Explain how you could run a formal hypothesis test comparing Model 1 to Model 3 to determine which is better.
    
    **c.** In Table 4 (pg. 10), Model 1 has a higher $Adj. R^2$ than Model 2, yet the extra term in Model 1 (an indicator variable for the National League) is not significant at the 5% level. Explain how this is possible.

## Guided exercises

5. The dataset `kingCountyHouses.csv` contains data on over 20,000 houses sold in King County, Washington (@kingcounty).^[from Sec. 1.8.2, Ex 3]

    We will use the following variables:
    
    - `price` = selling price of the house
date = date house was sold, measured in days since January 1, 2014
    - `sqft` = interior square footage

    *See textbook for full list of variables.*
    
    **a.** Fit a simple linear regression model with `price` as the response variable and `sqrt` as the explanatory variable (Model 1). Interpret the slope coefficient. *(For this exercise, you can interpret the coefficient in terms of an increase in 1 sqft. In practice, we'd want to interpret the coefficient in terms of a more meaningful increase, e.g., 100 sqft.)*
    
    **b.** Create a new variable, `logprice`, the natural log of price. Fit Model 2, where `logprice` is now the response variable and `sqft` is still the explanatory variable. Write out the regression equation. How is the `logprice` expected to change when `sqft` increases by 1? 
    
    **c.** Recall that $$\log\big(\frac{a}{b}\big) = \log(a) - \log(b)$$ Use this to to derive how price is expected to change as sqft increases by 1, based on Model 2.
    
    **d.** State in words how price is expected to change when sqft increases by 1.
    
    **e.** Fit Model 3 where price and `logsqft` are the response and explanatory variables, respectively. How does the predicted price change as sqft increases by 1%? *As a hint, this is the same as multiplying sqft by 1.01.*

## Open-ended exercises 

5. A student collected data from a restaurant where she was a waitress (Dahlquist and Dong 2011). The student was interested in learning under what conditions a waitress can expect the largest tips — for example: At dinner time or late at night? From younger or older patrons? From patrons receiving free meals? From patrons drinking alcohol? From patrons tipping with cash or credit? Data can be found in `TipData.csv`. ^[From Sec. 1.8.3 Ex 3] 

  Here is a quick description of the variables collected:

  - Day = day of the week
  - Meal = time of day (Lunch, Dinner, Late Night)
  - Payment = how bill was paid (Credit, Cash, Credit wit Cash tip)
  - Party = number of people in the party
  - Age = age category of person paying the bill (Yault, Middle, -     SenCit)
  - GiftCard = was gift card used?
  - Comps = was part of the meal complimentary?
  - Alcohol = was alcohol purchased?
  - Bday = was a free birthday meal or treat given?
  - Bill = total size of the bill
  - W.tip = total amount paid (bill plus tip)
  - Tip = amount of the tip
  - Tip.Percentage = proportion of the bill represented by the tip

    Conduct a regression analysis that can be used to determine under what conditions can the waitress expect to receive the largest tips relative to the amount spent at the table. Thus, the response variable for the analysis will be `Tip Percentage`. The analysis should include the following: 

    - Exploratory data analysis
    - Details of the process used to select the final model 
    - Assessment of the model assumptions for the model. 
    - Description of the conditions in which the waitress can expect the largest tips based on your final model. This should include an indication of the variables that are statistically significant. 


# Submission

**Before you wrap up the assignment, make sure all documents are updated on your GitHub repo. We will be checking these to make sure you have been practicing how to commit and push changes.**

**Remember -- you must turn in a PDF file to the Gradescope page before the submission deadline for full credit.** 

To submit your assignment: 

- Go to http://www.gradescope.com and click *Log in* in the top right corner. 

- Click *School Credentials* `r emo::ji("arrow_right")` *Duke NetID* and log in using your NetID credentials.

- Click on your *STA 310* course. 

- Click on the assignment, and you'll be prompted to submit it.

- Mark the pages associated with each exercise. All of the pages of your assignment should be associated with at least one question (i.e., should be "checked").

# Grading

| **Total** | **50** |
|-------------------------------------------------------------|:--:|
| Ex 1 | 5 |

| Workflow & formatting | 3|

-  The "Workflow & formatting" grade is to based on the organization of the assignment write up along with the reproducible workflow. This includes ans having an organized write up with neat and readable headers, code, ad narrative, including properly rendered mathematical notation. It also includes having a reproducible R Markdown document used to render the submitted PDF, and implementing version using multiple commits with informative commit messages.
