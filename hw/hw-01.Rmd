# Instructions 

  - Write all narrative using full sentences and show all code in the PDF. 
  - If you are fitting model, display the model neatly in a table (The `tidy` and `kable` functions can help!).  
  - If you are creating a plot, use clear labels for all axes, titles, etc. 
  - Commit regularly, at least after each exercise.
  - When you're done, we should be able to knit the final version of the .Rmd in your GitHub repo to get the PDF submitted to Gradescope.

# Learning goals 

This assignment is a review of multiple linear regression. The goal is that by the end of the assignment, you are able to 

- produce and interpret plots and summary statistics.
- fit and interpret the coefficients of a linear model.
- use statistical inference to draw conclusions about predictor variables.
- understand assumptions for linear regression and identify potential violations.
- use statistical measures to select model of best fit. 
- complete assignment using a reproducible workflow that includes writing results in R Markdown and using GitHub for version control.

# Exercises 

## Conceptual exercises 

1. Researchers record the number of cricket chirps per minute and temperature during that time to investigate whether the number of chirps varies with the temperature.^[from Sec. 1.8.1, Ex 1]
  
    **a.** Identify the response and explanatory variable(s).
    
    **b.** Write the assumptions for linear regression in the context of the problem. 

2. For each of over 27,000 overnight permits for the Boundary Waters Canoe area, the zip code for the group leader has been translated to the distance traveled and socioeconomic data. Thus, for each zip code we can model the number of trips made as a function of distance traveled and various socioeconomic measures. ^[from Sec. 1.8.1, Ex 2]

    **a.** Identify the response and explanatory variable(s). 
    
    **b.** Identify which model assumption(s) are violated. Briefly explain your choice.

3. In a 2011 article in *The Sport Journal*, @farrar2011new attempt to show that Major League Baseball general managers did not immediately embrace the findings of Michael Lewis’s book *Moneyball* [@lewis2004moneyball]. They contend that players’ on-base percentage remained relatively undercompensated compared to slugging percentage three years after the book came out. Two regression models are described: Team Run Production Model and Player Salary Model.^[from Sec. 1.8.1, Ex 4]

    [Click here](articles/thesportjournal.org-A New Test of the Moneyball Hypothesis.pdf) for a PDF of the article.
    
    **a.** In Table 3: Coefficients for the Team Run Production Model (pg.9-10), the authors contend that Model 1 is better than Model 3.
    Could you argue that Model 3 is actually better? Briefly explain.
    
    **b.** Explain how you could run a formal hypothesis test comparing Model 1 to Model 3 to determine which is better.
    
    **c.** In Table 4 (pg. 10), Model 1 has a higher $Adj. R^2$ than Model 2, yet the extra term in Model 1 (an indicator variable for the National League) is not significant at the 5% level. Explain how this is possible.

## Guided exercises

5. The dataset `kingCountyHouses.csv` contains data on over 20,000 houses sold in King County, Washington (@kingcounty).^[from Sec. 1.8.2, Ex 3]

    We will use the following variables:
    
    - `price` = selling price of the house
date = date house was sold, measured in days since January 1, 2014
    - `sqft` = interior square footage

    *See textbook for full list of variables.*
    
    **a.** Fit a simple linear regression model with `price` as the response variable and `sqrt` as the explanatory variable (Model 1). Interpret the slope coefficient in terms of the expected change in price when sqft increases by 100.
    
    **b.** Create a new variable, `logprice`, the natural log of price. Fit Model 2, where `logprice` is now the response variable and `sqft` is still the explanatory variable. Write out the regression equation. How is the `logprice` expected to change when `sqft` increases by 100? 
    
    **c.** Based on Model 2, how is the price expected to change when `sqft` increases by 100?
    
    **e.** Fit Model 3 where price and `logsqft` are the response and explanatory variables, respectively. How does the predicted price change as sqft increases by 5%? *As a hint, this is the same as multiplying sqft by 1.05.*

## Open-ended exercises 

5. A student collected data from a restaurant where she was a waitress [@tipdata]. The student was interested in learning under what conditions a waitress can expect the largest tips relative to the size of the bill — for example: At dinner time or late at night? From younger or older patrons? From patrons receiving free meals? From patrons drinking alcohol? From patrons tipping with cash or credit? Data can be found in `TipData.csv`. ^[From Sec. 1.8.3 Ex 3]

    **A description of the variables is in the `README` of the data folder.**

    Build a model that the student can used to determine under which conditions to expect the largest tips relative to the size of the bill. The response variable for the analysis will be `Tip.Percentage`. Justify the selection of your final model and write a one 1 -2 paragraph summary of your conclusions based on the model. 
    
    The analysis should the following:
    
    - Exploratory data analysis
    - Details of the process used to select the final model 
    - Assessment of the model assumptions for the final model. 
    - 1 -2  paragraph summary of your conclusions. 
    
  
  
    *This question will be graded on*
      - *The quality and accuracy of the model selection process. "Quality" includes an assessment of the comprehensiveness and decision-making in the process to select the final model. This includes the exploratory data analysis.*
      - *Quality and accuracy of the summary of results. "Quality" includes includes an assessment of whether the summary is (1) comprehensive, (2) answers the primary research question, and (3) tells a cohesive story (e.g., a list of interpretations will not receive full credit).*
      - *Quality and accuracy of any supporting plots, summary statistics, and model output.*
      

# Submission

**Before you wrap up the assignment, make sure all documents are updated on your GitHub repo. We will be checking these to make sure you have been practicing how to commit and push changes.**

**Remember -- you must turn in a PDF file to the Gradescope page before the submission deadline for full credit.** 

To submit your assignment: 

- Go to http://www.gradescope.com and click *Log in* in the top right corner.

|-------------------------------------------------------------|:--:|
| Ex 1 | 5 |
| Ex 2 | 3 |
| Ex 3 | 9|
| Ex 4 | 10 | 
| Ex 5 | 20 |
| Workflow & formatting | 3|

-  The "Workflow & formatting" grade is to based on the organization of the assignment write up along with the reproducible workflow. This includes having an organized write up with neat and readable headers, code, and narrative, including properly rendered mathematical notation. It also includes having a reproducible R Markdown document used to render the submitted PDF, and implementing version using multiple commits with informative commit messages.
